## Code Validation


### HTML


I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [404.html](https://github.com/allaafaham/calisthenics-project/blob/main/404.html) | [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https://allaafaham.github.io/calisthenics-project/404.html) | ![screenshot](documentation/validation/html--404.png) |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | URL | Screenshot | Notes |

## Responsiveness


All pages were thoroughly tested for responsiveness across screen sizes starting from 320px and above

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Page | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Notes |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Some warnings are outside of my control, and mobile results tend to be lower than desktop.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-home.png) |
| Basic Workouts | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-basicworkouts.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-basicworkouts.png) |
| Progress | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-progress.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-progress.png) |
| Booking | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-booking.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-booking.png) |
| 404 | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/mobile-404.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse/desktop-404.png) |
